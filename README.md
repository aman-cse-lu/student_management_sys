#INTRODUCTION
Student Management System is software which is helpful for students as well as the school
authorities. In the current system all the activities are done manually. It is very time consuming
and costly. Our Student Management System deals with the various activities related to the
students.

#
There are mainly 3 modules in this software
•User module
•Student Module
•Mark management


In the Software we can register as a user and user has of two types, student and administrator.
Administrator has the power to add new user and can edit and delete a user. A student can
register as user and can add edit and delete his profile. The administrator can add edit and delete
marks for the student. All the users can see the marks.
System Analysis

#EXISTING SYSTEM:

System Analysis is a detailed study of the various operations performed by a system and them
relationships within and outside of the system. Here the key question is- what all problems
exist in the present system? What must be done to solve the problem? Analysis begins when a
user or manager begins a study of the program using existing system.
During analysis, data collected on the various files, decision points and transactions handled
by the present system. The commonly used tools in the system are Data Flow Diagram,
interviews, etc. Training, experience and common sense are required for collection of relevant
information needed to develop the system. A good analysis model should provide not only the
mechanisms of problem understanding but also the frame work of the solution. Thus, it should
be studied thoroughly by collecting data about the system.
Then the proposed system should be analysed thoroughly in accordance with the needs.
System analysis can be categorized into four parts.
System planning and initial investigation
Information Gathering
Applying analysis tools for structured analysis
Feasibility study
Cost/ Benefit analysis.
In the current system we need to keep a number of records related to the student and want to
enter the details of the student and the marks manually. In this system only, the teacher or the
school authority views the mark of the student and they want to enter the details of the student.
This is time consuming and has much cost.

#PROPOSED SYSTEM:

In our proposed system we have the provision for adding the details of the
students by themselves. So, the overhead of the school authorities and the teachers is become
less. Another advantage of the system is that it is very easy to edit the details of the student and
delete a student when it found unnecessary. The marks of the student are added in the database
and so students can also view the marks whenever they want.


Our proposed system has several advantages
•User friendly interface
•Fast access to database
•Less error
•More Storage Capacity
•Search facility
•Look and Feel Environment
•Quick transaction

All the manual difficulties in managing the student details in a school or college have been
rectified by implementing computerization.


FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS
Whatever we think need not be feasible. It is wise to think about the feasibility of any problem
we undertake. Feasibility is the study of impact, which happens in the organization by the
development of a system. The impact can be either positive or negative. When the positives
nominate the negatives, then the system is considered feasible. Here the feasibility study can
be performed in two ways such as technical feasibility and Economical Feasibility.


TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY:
We can strongly say’s that it is technically feasible, since there will not be much difficulty in
getting required resources for the development and maintaining the system as well. All the
resources needed for the development of the software as well as the maintenance of the same
is available in the organization here we are utilizing the resources which are available already.


ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY:
Development of this application is highly economically feasible. The organization needed not
spend much money for the development of the system already available. The only thing is to
be done is making an environment for the development with an effective supervision. I f we
are doing so, we can attain the maximum usability of the corresponding resources. Even after
the development, the organization will not be in condition to invest more in the organization.
Therefore, the system is economically feasible.
